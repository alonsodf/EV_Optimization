# Jupyter Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, analysis, and demonstration of optimization algorithms.

## Notebook Organization

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- `01_data_exploration.ipynb` - Initial data exploration and visualization
- `02_vehicle_analysis.ipynb` - Analysis of vehicle performance data
- `03_battery_analysis.ipynb` - Battery performance and degradation analysis

### Algorithm Development
- `04_battery_optimization.ipynb` - Development and testing of battery optimization algorithms
- `05_route_optimization.ipynb` - Route planning and optimization
- `06_charging_optimization.ipynb` - Charging station placement and scheduling

### Results and Visualization
- `07_results_visualization.ipynb` - Visualization of optimization results
- `08_comparative_analysis.ipynb` - Comparison of different algorithms
- `09_sensitivity_analysis.ipynb` - Parameter sensitivity studies

## Best Practices

### Notebook Structure
1. **Introduction** - Clear description of the notebook's purpose
2. **Data Loading** - Load and validate input data
3. **Analysis/Computation** - Main analysis or algorithm implementation
4. **Results** - Present findings with visualizations
5. **Conclusions** - Summarize key insights and next steps

### Code Quality
- Use clear variable names and add comments
- Break complex analysis into well-defined functions
- Import required libraries at the top
- Use markdown cells to explain methodology

### Reproducibility
- Set random seeds for stochastic algorithms
- Include package versions in requirements
- Save intermediate results when computations are expensive
- Document any external data dependencies

## Running Notebooks

1. Ensure you have installed the project requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Start Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Navigate to the notebook you want to run

## Notebook Templates

Template notebooks are provided to maintain consistency:
- `template_analysis.ipynb` - Template for data analysis notebooks
- `template_algorithm.ipynb` - Template for algorithm development notebooks

## Sharing Notebooks

Before committing notebooks:
1. Clear all outputs to reduce file size
2. Ensure notebooks run from start to finish
3. Remove any hardcoded paths or credentials
4. Add appropriate documentation and comments

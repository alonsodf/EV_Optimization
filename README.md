## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip or conda for package management
- Git for version control

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alonsodf/EV_Optimization.git
cd EV_Optimization
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

[Add specific usage instructions as you develop the project]

## Data Guidelines

**Important**: Large datasets should NOT be committed directly to this repository. Instead:

1. **Small datasets** (< 10 MB): Can be stored in `data/` directory
2. **Large datasets** (> 10 MB): 
   - Use Git LFS (Large File Storage) for datasets < 100 MB
   - For very large datasets, store externally (cloud storage) and provide download links/scripts
   - Include sample/subset data for testing and development

3. **Data documentation**: Always include:
   - Data source and collection method
   - Data format and schema description
   - Any preprocessing steps applied
   - Usage restrictions or licenses
